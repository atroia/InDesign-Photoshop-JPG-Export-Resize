This is part InDesign script part Photoshop script. 

This script exports a book cover spread (with no bleed) to JPG from InDesign and then opens the image in Photoshop and crops it to the trimsize and saves both high and low resolution files.

Note: this is a work in progress and primarily works for tradebook size of 6x9. It will work for 4.25x7 and 4.75x7 but no other trims sizes yet.
